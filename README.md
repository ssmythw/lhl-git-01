# Scott Smyth's Notes

## Summary

This is a repository contains all of the notes taken by taken by [ssmythw](https://github.com/ssmythw) for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.

### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

- [Week 1](/Week_1)
  - [Day 1](/Week_1/Day_1)
